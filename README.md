COD2-patchswitcher
To use this program you must have Call of Duty 2 installed.
Its intended usage is for installing patches, and therefore you 
MUST KEEP THE STRUCT FOLDER.

THE STRUCT FOLDER MUST NOT BE MODIFIED IN ANY WAY
SINCE THE PROGRAM WILL NOT WORK AS INTENDED IF IT IS.

To run the program just keep the cod 2 patchswitcher.exe in the same directory as the
struct folder and it should run just fine.
Then paste the path to your cod 2 folder or browse using BROWSE FOLDER button.
If your Call of Duty 2 installation is located within C:\Program Files (x86) then it MUST
BE RAN AS ADMINISTRATOR TO GAIN PRIVILEGES.
