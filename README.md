COD2-patchswitcher
To use this program you must have Call of Duty 2 installed.
Its intended usage is for installing patches, and therefore you 
<b>MUST KEEP THE STRUCT FOLDER.</b>

<b>THE STRUCT FOLDER MUST NOT BE MODIFIED IN ANY WAY
SINCE THE PROGRAM WILL NOT WORK AS INTENDED IF IT IS.</b>

To run the program just keep the cod 2 patchswitcher.exe in the same directory as the
struct folder and it should run just fine.
Then paste the path to your cod 2 folder or browse using BROWSE FOLDER button.

<b>If your Call of Duty 2 installation is located within C:\Program Files (x86) then it MUST
BE RAN AS ADMINISTRATOR TO GAIN PRIVILEGES.</b>
